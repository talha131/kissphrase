### Summary ###
Ever find yourself typing the same phrases over and over again? Wouldn't it be easier to let your computer type them for you? (Hate rhetorical questions?)

Enter Kissphrase. A simple System Preferences pane which allows you to define a set of global keywords for oft used phrases. If you type the keyword followed by a space, tab, or return in any program, Kissphrase will paste your phrase on top of the keyword!

Kissphrase attempts to follow the KISS principle - keep it simple, stupid. If you require a program with more features, there are other alternatives out there which may serve you better.

Kissphrase requires Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or higher to run and may only function normally for English language users. This version (0.5) is a beta and as such may contain bugs.
